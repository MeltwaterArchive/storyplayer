# Learning Storyplayer

Storyplayer has two main uses:

1. Add stories to your code repository so that you can [test your code](test-your-code/index.html) as you develop it.
1. Build up a central repository of stories so that you can [test your platform](test-your-platform/index.html) through QA, Staging and Production environments.

Start here with [getting setup for running Storyplayer](getting-setup/index.html)
