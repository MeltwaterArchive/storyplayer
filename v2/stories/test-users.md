# Test Users

The vast majority of apps these days involve registering new users, logging in / authenticating as an existing user, and the things that different users (and different types of user) can and cannot do.

Storyplayer's codebase currently does have support for generating and remembering test users, but in all honesty we're not sure whether it's right for general use yet or not.  We're going to look at this for Storyplayer v1.6.

This is a placeholder for now.
