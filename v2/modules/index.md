# Storyplayer Modules

Storyplayer's architecture breaks down into the following components:

* Storyplayer's runtime
* Prose modules shipped with Storyplayer (aka the [global dialect](../prose/global-dialect.html))
* Additional Prose modules created for your own needs (aka the [local dialect](../prose/local-dialect.html))
* Supporting libraries (such as Stone)
* Supporting bundled utilities (such as Selenium server)

_Prose modules_ are where all of the work is.
