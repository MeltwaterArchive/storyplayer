# Deprecated Modules

## Introduction

There are a number of old Storyplayer v1 modules that we will be removing in Storyplayer v3. We've included these modules in Storyplayer v2 to help you port your stories.

## When To Use Deprecated Modules

Only use deprecated modules in tests originally written for Storyplayer v1. Do not use these modules in any new stories.
