# Device Configuration

When you run the `storyplayer` command-line tool, you can use the `-d` switch to tell Storyplayer which web browser (or other UI device) it should use in your test.  Storyplayer ships with a number of devices already pre-configured (such as [local web browsers](../devices/localbrowsers.html) and [a wider range of browsers available via Sauce Labs](../devices/saucelabs.html)).

## Defining Your Own Device

At the moment, it isn't possible to define additional devices for Storyplayer v2. We will be revisiting this when we upgrade the support for SauceLabs later this year.
