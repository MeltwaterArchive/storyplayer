# Design

In this section, I'm going to look at the design of Storyplayer and share with you the key items that have guided Storyplayer's invention and evolution to date.

## Target Audience And Target Environment

Storyplayer's target audience falls into three main camps: people who will write and run tests, people who will just run tests, and people who want to know the results of running tests.

### Test Authors

People who will write and run tests are:

* Software developers who are testing their own app
* Software developers who are maintaining someone else's app
* Software testers who are testing someone else's app

The key challenge here is catering for the different skill sets found amongst test authors.  There will be a wide ranging mix of ability both on designing the tests and coding the tests.  Storyplayer needs to make it easy to design and write basic tests *without* getting in the way of sophisticated testing.

It's also important that it's very easy to use Storyplayer to run tests.

### Test Users

People who will just run tests are:

* Software developers who are evaluating someone else's app
* Software testers who are accepting someone else's app

### Gatekeepers

People who want to know the test results are:

* Project managers
* Product managers
* Operational management


## Automate All The Things To Reproduce All The Problems

One of the interesting things of working with people who consider themselves smart (an observation that I'm making without judgment!) is that they prefer to perform ad-hoc manual activities. Their confidence in their abilities mean that although they are aware of the benefits of automation, they have a built-in bias towards believing that automation is something that other people need.
