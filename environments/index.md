# Test Environments

Storyplayer can take away the pain of testing complex software by creating new test environments on demand.

## Why Are Test Environments Important?

Whenever you are testing complex software, the environment you're using to test it in has a big impact on whether or not your tests are _reproducible_.  If you can re-create the test environment every time that you run your tests, you're much more likely to get the same results each time.
