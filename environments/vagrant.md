# Creating Test Environments Using Vagrant

Storyplayer supports creating and testing against virtual machines using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com).

We'll be adding more documentation about this shortly, but if you need to know more now, the reference documentation for the [Vagrant module](../../modules/vagrant/index.html) is already available.
