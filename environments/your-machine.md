# Testing On Your Machine

Testing against software running on your dev box gives you the fastest workflow whilst you're developing new features.  If you're using dynamic languages, there's normally nothing to install at all - just save your files in your editor



## Setting Up For Testing

To test locally, you need to be able to run your application on your dev box.

* Make sure you can start your application is running locally
* Use your web browser to manually test your application, to prove that it works well enough for you to start automating your tests
