# Storyplayer

Bring your user and service stories to life through your test automation.

## Introduction

[Storyplayer](https://github.com/datasift/storyplayer) is [DataSift](http://datasift.com)'s in-house tool for automating the functional testing of our user and service stories.  We've built it to make it easy to create repeatable end-to-end tests, and to make it just as easy to create repeatable functional tests.

Additionally, Storyplayer can measure non-functional requirements at the same time.

Storyplayer is highly modular, and can be easily extended to support your own custom needs.

### What can you test with Story Player?

 * Back-end services
 * APIs
 * Front end interfaces

## Licensing

[Storyplayer](https://github.com/datasift/storyplayer) is Open Source software.

### Tales, Stories, and Prose

Storyplayer introduces terminology designed to help developers and managers think about testing using high-level concepts before digging into the details of the implementation. The core concept is that of a [User Story](/storyplayer/stories/index.html).
