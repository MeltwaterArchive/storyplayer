# Storyplayer

Bring your user and service stories to life through your test automation.

## Introduction

[Storyplayer](https://github.com/datasift/storyplayer) is [DataSift's](http://datasift.com) in-house tool for automating the functional testing of our user and service stories.  We've built it to make it easy to create repeatable end-to-end tests, and to make it just as easy to create repeatable functional tests.

Additionally, Storyplayer can measure non-functional requirements at the same time.

Storyplayer is highly modular, and can be easily extended to support your own custom needs.
