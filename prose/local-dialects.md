# Local Dialects

_Local dialects_ are your Prose modules, the reusable modules that you write for your unique needs.

Your _storyteller.json_ file should include the following configuration:

{% highlight json %}
{
	"local-dialects": [
		"path/to/your/PSR0/tree"
	]
}
{% endhighlight %}

We'll expand this section shortly with much better details about how this works.
