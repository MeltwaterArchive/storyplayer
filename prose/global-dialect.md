# The Global Dialect

The Storyplayer Global dialect is defined in the [modules](/storyplayer/modules/index.html) that ship with Storyplayer.

The source code of the Prose modules can be found in the [src/php/DataSift/Storyplayer/Prose](https://github.com/datasift/storyplayer/tree/develop/src/php/DataSift/Storyplayer/Prose) directory of the Storyplayer repo.

We'll be expanding this section in the next couple of weeks.
