# Test Setup / Teardown Phases

    // ========================================================================
    //
    // STORY SETUP / TEAR-DOWN
    //
    // ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test setup / teardown is used to set up tests themselves.  Test customization happens here.  Tasks executed during this phase include, but are no limited to, downloading test data, detecting environment, configuring additional software, etc.

We'll be expanding this section in the next couple of weeks.
